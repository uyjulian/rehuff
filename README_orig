You are allowed to use it FOR PERSONAL EXPERIMENTAL PURPOSES ONLY.

This is mostly because I can't yet decide on which license to use,
and the code isn't finished yet anyway; if you feel you have a
non-personal or non-experimental use for it, please contact me;
if this program makes you want to spend some cash contact
donate@xiph.org instead.

Have fun,

Segher
